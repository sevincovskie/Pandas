The van came to a stop as we prepared to leave it to cross the street to our other friends house.  Suddenly, a giant dark blue flash appeared over the entire horizon above the tree line in front of us.  We were face to the southwest.  We all stared up through the vans window at the flash.                                            Instantly, the dark blue light was replaced by a gigantic saucer shaped craft.  I estimate it to have been over 100 yards in length.  The height to be over 75 to 100 feet.  It was metallic in nature as you could see with the reflection of continuous blue flashing lights traveling around the center of the craft.  There was never any sound whatsoever.  One of my friends began to rock back and forth as the driver attempted to start the van.  It would not start. Then in a brilliant dark blue flash, it vanished as quickly as it came.
